These definition statements control which input/outputs do on the arduino.

So, for example, the trigger pin on the ultrasonic is plugged into arduino GPIO 12, and the echo pin is right next to it, on input 11.

The tricky ones to understand are the connects that are set to 5v or ground.
We are using the code to set the pin to either 0 or 5v by pulling it up or down.

In the case of the PIR, it's fine with both 5v and ground from a PIN.
The ultrasonic likes to be connected to an actual 5v pin so it has enough power.

Lastly, the adafruit LED scren just needs the 3v, so it gets the 3v pin (and we can't set a pin to 3v, since Uno3 only has 5v logic)
